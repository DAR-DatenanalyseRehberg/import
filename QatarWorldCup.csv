Qatar World Cup,ONE LOVE: DFB CAPTAIN WEARS ARMBAND AGAINST DISCRIMINATION,"o send a signal against discrimination and for diversity, the captain of the DFB team will wear a special captain's armband at the next two UEFA Nations League matches in September and at the World Cup in Qatar in November and December. This is adorned with a heart in bright colors, representing diversity, and the inscription ""One Love.""  The campaign is a joint effort by the national teams of England, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Wales, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Germany. The idea arose within the framework of the UEFA working group, which, on the initiative of some European national associations, is dealing with issues of human and workers* rights in Qatar up to the 2022 World Cup and beyond. The representative of the German Football Association (DFB) in the UEFA working group is General Secretary Heike Ullrich.  The message of the ""One Love Bracelet"" is directed against any form of discrimination. It opposes the exclusion of LGBTQ+ people, but also racism and anti-Semitism. The color scheme symbolizes this. Red, black and green are found in the pan-African flag, while pink, yellow and blue symbolize the pansexual flag. The nations involved in the ""One Love Bracelet"" campaign want to send a positive message for all forms of diversity. The UEFA working group, which included DFB general secretary Heike Ullrich, followed a suggestion from the Dutch soccer association KNVB for the color scheme. The KNVB has already been using this color combination for two years to symbolize that the love of soccer unconditionally unites all people.",157
Qatar World Cup,FINAL,"Argentina started the match in dominant fashion and took a 2-0 lead before the end of the first half through a penalty kick converted by Lionel Messi and a goal by Ángel Di María. The French surprisingly fell far short of their potential and failed to register a single shot on goal in the first half, which, among other things, led France coach Didier Deschamps to substitute both strikers Olivier Giroud as early as the 41st minute, as well as Ousmane Dembélé, who was responsible for the penalty for Argentina. In the second half, the French initially continued to lack chances, but gradually found their way into the game and finally managed to equalize within 95 seconds thanks to a double strike by Kylian Mbappé (penalty in the 80th minute, goal in the 81st minute). Mbappé thus became the fifth player to score in two World Cup finals after Brazilians Pele and Vavá, Germany's Paul Breitner and France's Zinédine Zidane. While France in particular pressed for a decision in the remaining minutes of regulation time, the game was evenly contested in the subsequent extra time. Argentina regained the lead in the 109th minute through a goal by Messi, but conceded the equalizer again in the 118th minute after Mbappé converted a handball penalty. Mbappé thus became the second player after Geoff Hurst (1966) to score a hat trick in a World Cup final. In the final minute of extra time, France's Randal Kolo Muani missed a great chance to win the game when he found himself alone in front of Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, but his shot was blocked by Martínez's foot. Argentina also missed a possible winning goal shortly after when Lautaro Martínez headed the ball past the French goal. Thus, the World Cup final had to be decided in a penalty shootout. In this, all Argentine shooters scored, while two French shooters missed, so that Argentina became soccer world champion for the third time after 1978 and 1986.",193
Qatar World Cup,GENERAL,"The final round of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 (English, Coupe du monde de soccer 2022, Arabic كأس العالم ۲۰۲۲, DMG Kaʾs al-ʿālam 2022) was the 22nd edition of the most important tournament for national soccer teams. The most important tournament for national soccer teams was held in the Arabian Gulf state of Qatar from November 20, 2022 to December 18, 2022.  The world champion for the third time was Argentina, which defeated defending champion France in a penalty shootout in the final. With the victory of the Argentine national team, the World Cup title went to a South American team for the first time since 2002. Third place went to reigning runner-up Croatia in the third-place match against Morocco, whose fourth-place finish was the best by an African national team in World Cup history. Host Qatar was eliminated after the group stage after three defeats without scoring a point, the worst result ever by a World Cup host. Germany also failed in the group stage, as it did four years earlier. Switzerland was eliminated in the round of 16, while Austria and reigning European champions Italy had already failed to qualify.  After the World Cup award to Qatar was accompanied by allegations of bribery from the very beginning, by 2020 at the latest there was clear evidence that FIFA officials had bought votes for the World Cup award to Qatar. In March 2015, it was finally decided that the tournament would be held for the first time toward the end of the year because of the intense summer heat on the Arabian Peninsula.  In the run-up to the World Cup, criticism of the host was voiced, mainly because of serious human rights violations in the country. In February 2021, the British newspaper The Guardian cited the number of 6500 migrant workers from five countries who have died since the World Cup was awarded in 2010[1][2] - Amnesty International published a report in August 2021 stating that 15,021 non-Qataris died between 2010 and 2019, with 70% of deaths not properly recorded. However, for both statistics, it is not known how many of these deaths were related to the construction of World Cup infrastructure projects.[3] During the preliminary round, the secretary general of Qatar's World Cup organizing committee, Hassan al-Thawadi, initially acknowledged ""between 400 and 500"" deaths in World Cup-related work.[4] Aside from the deaths, Qatar's minor, and in some cases complete, failure to pay, house, and feed workers has also been criticized. Other criticisms of the host Qatar include, in particular, discrimination against homosexuals, Qatar's lack of an internationally significant soccer tradition, the relocation of the tournament from summer to winter, air-conditioned stadiums in the middle of the desert in an era of climate change, and Qatar's alleged support of terrorist groups.  Qatar - a country with a total population of three million people - expected more than 1.2 million visitors for the month-long soccer tournament. Organizers said three million tickets had been sold prior to the World Cup. The 64 matches took place in and near the capital, Doha, in eight stadiums no more than 68 kilometers apart.",315
Qatar World Cup,CRITICISM,"The awarding of the World Cup was the subject of various criticisms. In addition to allegations of corruption, the lack of soccer tradition and the difficult climatic conditions in Qatar were pointed out, and the human rights situation in Qatar was also criticized. Some argued that hosting the World Cup could spur the country to reform. However, Wenzel Michalski, the Germany director of Human Rights Watch, summed up toward the end of the tournament that both Qatar and FIFA continued to be ""completely indifferent to people's rights."" He said that the country's human rights record had been ""very poor.  The then president of the German Football Association (DFB), Theo Zwanziger, who is considered to be an opponent of the World Cup in Qatar, already spoke out in favor of a new awarding of the World Cup at the end of 2011. The former president of the English Football Association, David Bernstein, also called for a new bidding process. However, the FIFA head at the time, Blatter, repeatedly made it clear that the World Cup would take place in Qatar. The only thing being discussed, he said, was whether the tournament should be moved to the winter season to avoid the summer heat there. In mid-May 2014, he called the awarding of the World Cup to Qatar a ""mistake"" for the first time, and shortly before the championship began, he called it a ""mistake."" The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) also campaigned for a re-bidding of the World Cup with its Re-run the Vote campaign. In Germany, this cause was supported by the Ver.di youth with a soccer tournament.",158
Qatar World Cup,CLIMATIC CONDITIONS,"A major objection to awarding the World Cup from the outset was that the stadiums would have to be air-conditioned because of the high summer temperatures of up to 50 degrees Celsius. Franz Beckenbauer then suggested moving the World Cup to the winter, which Blatter also supported a month later, although he put this into perspective a short time later. On January 20, 2012, FIFA clarified in an official statement that there were ""currently no concrete plans"" to move the 2022 World Cup from summer to winter. This ""would have to be initiated by the Qatar Football Association and presented to the FIFA Executive Committee."" Nevertheless, on July 17, 2013, Blatter again spoke in favor of moving the event to winter.  UEFA President Michel Platini was initially critical of the awarding of the World Cup to Qatar due to the summer heat and was in favor of moving the tournament to the winter. After his son Laurent joined the board of directors of Qatar Sport Investment (QSI), which became public in February 2012, father Michel admitted to having voted in favor of Qatar. Platini was a member of the board of directors of Qatar Sport Investment (QSI).  On October 4, 2013, the FIFA Executive Committee announced that it would not make a decision on whether to move the World Cup to the winter until after it had been held in 2014. It was decided to conduct a consultation process to talk to all stakeholders.  Moving the World Cup to winter had been opposed by the International Ski Federation (FIS), which sought a joint resolution from the other winter sports federations against hosting the World Cup in winter, and the IOC also feared a clash with the 2022 Winter Games, which had not yet been awarded at that time. On November 9, 2013, FIFA President Blatter ruled out hosting the event in January or February out of respect for the Olympic family and the organization. The decision to move the World Cup to winter was made by FIFA.  On February 24, 2015, after six months of deliberations and three meetings, FIFA's 2018-2024 International Match Calendar Working Group announced that ""the period from the end of November to the end of December is considered the most viable solution for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup."" A shortened tournament duration was also proposed. The FIFA Executive Committee confirmed the proposal at its meeting on March 19-20, 2015",236
Qatar World Cup,HALF- EMPTY STADIUMS,"At the World Cup opening match on November 20, 2022, between Qatar and Ecuador, which was 0-2 at halftime, a large portion of the crowd left the stadium during the second half. None of the group matches were played in a stadium that was even close to full, and even the round of 16 matches were moderately attended for a World Cup.",33
Qatar World Cup,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AND GREENWASHING,"In total, FIFA calculated that 3.6 million tons of CO₂ would be released into the earth's atmosphere as a result of the World Cup. According to research by Deutschlandfunk, however, this figure was underestimated: The resulting emissions were to be offset with CO₂ certificates. However, an actual CO₂ saving was questionable and thus greenwashing was given, because research by Tagesschau revealed that the certificates were used to promote projects that would have been carried out anyway.",49
Qatar World Cup,HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION,"Human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are frequently disregarded in Qatar. Freedom House basically classifies Qatar as not free. In the Freedom in the World 2021 report, Qatar received a score of 7/40 on political rights and 18/60 on civil liberties, for an overall score of 25/100 (not free). According to human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Qatar is responsible for various human rights violations and discrimination, particularly in the areas of dealing with low-wage migrants, women's rights, religious freedom, civil rights, press freedom, and corporal punishment.  Since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, many human rights issues have received increased attention in the international media and from human rights organizations. The Danish national team's demand for ""human rights for all"" on a training jersey was rejected by FIFA.  In October 2022, the French judiciary opened an investigation into violations of the fundamental rights of migrant workers in Qatar. The human rights group Sherpa had launched judicial investigations against Vinci Construction Grands Projects, a subsidiary of the Vinci construction group. The organization had already filed a lawsuit against the company in 2019, along with the organization Committee Against Modern Slavery and several migrant workers.",134
Qatar World Cup,HOMOSEXUALITY AND ONE-LOVE-CAPTAIN BOND,"Another objection many Western countries have to awarding the Games to Qatar is that homosexual acts are punishable by law in Qatar. Homosexuals therefore face discrimination and persecution on a daily basis in the country. Qatari World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman called homosexuality ""spiritual harm"" in an interview with ZDF that was later cut short. The organization Human Rights Watch then warned homosexual people against traveling to the World Cup in Qatar.  The German as well as several European national teams planned to compete in the World Cup with armbands in bright colors and the inscription ""One Love"" to oppose the exclusion of LGBTQ+ people as well as racism and anti-Semitism. The colors resemble those of the rainbow flag, which is a symbol of the lesbian and gay movement. Politicians, fan associations, CSD Deutschland e. V. and Human Rights Watch criticized the symbol of the armband as weak and untrustworthy. The One Love armband showed ""what fear you as an association have of FIFA and sponsors."" France captain Hugo Lloris backed the president of the French Football Federation FFF, Noël Le Graët, who had spoken out against the armband, and does not wear the armband.  Two days before the start of the tournament, FIFA announced that wearing the ""One Love"" captain's armband was not compatible with the rules of world football's governing body and could lead to sanctions. Instead, teams are to wear captain's armbands with the mottos it specifies.  FIFA also referred to Article 13.8.1 of the Equipment Regulations, which requires the captain of each team at FIFA final tournaments to wear an armband provided by FIFA.  After FIFA threatened that any player wearing the ""one-love"" armband would receive a yellow card, the eight European federations involved said they would refrain from wearing the armband.  Some experts doubted that instructing referees to punish wearing the ""One Love"" armband with a yellow card was covered by the rulebook. As a result, the DFB was criticized for giving in to FIFA. BBC commentator Alex Scott appeared in front of the camera wearing the One Love armband in protest, RTL magazine Exclusiv presenter Bella Lesnik also wore the One Love armband during her broadcast. ZDF commentator Claudia Neumann wore a armband and a T-shirt with rainbow colors during the USA v Wales match. REWE Group chairman Lionel Souque described the DFB's stance on the One Love armband as ""scandalous"". Rewe, a supermarket chain belonging to the group, then suspended its partnership with the DFB with immediate effect. Prices for Rewe's official World Cup scrapbook and the accompanying stickers were also canceled. The previous sales of the stickers and the album will be donated in full to ""good causes"" after the campaign expires. In the team photo before the first group match, the players of the German team covered their mouths, which caused a stir throughout Europe as a clear statement against FIFA's ban on the one-love bandage. However, the majority of the team had spoken out against this gesture and wanted to focus on the sporting side.  The politicization of the team was also criticized in the media.  After three games and elimination, the German team was seen off on Qatari television in a round of talks with their mouths closed and waving. An armband worn by German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser at the German national team's first match is to be added to the collection of the Haus der Geschichte Foundation",347
Qatar World Cup,WOMEN’S RIGHTS,"The handling of women's rights on the ground is also discussed: a Mexican employee of a FIFA partner for the preparation of the World Cup was charged with extramarital sex. Earlier, in June 2021, the woman had reported a rape by a Latin American acquaintance. However, the man she accused claimed to have had a relationship with her, after which both were investigated for extramarital sex. In Qatar, where Sharia law is the primary source of law, both faced a seven-year prison sentence if convicted, and the woman, who is Muslim, also faced 100 lashes. The criminal case against her was dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar. The man was also allowed to leave Qatar and was not imprisoned.",70
Qatar World Cup,PAID FANS,"In early November 2022, Sportschau reported that the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee (WCOC) has invited some 450 fans from 59 countries to Qatar for the entire tournament. They will be paid for flights, accommodation, participation in numerous on-site activities and a daily allowance of 250 riyals (about 70 euros). The participating fans agree in a contract to support the World Cup positively on site and in social media, and also not to report negatively about Qatar, the organizing committee, or the World Cup, thus ensuring a positive image.[154] Less than a week before the start of the World Cup, the World Cup OC withdrew the promised daily allowance from the 450 invited fans, claiming that it wanted to protect them from the ""erroneous, misinformed claim"" that they were ""paid fans."" In a letter dated November 15, 2022, the World Cup OC asks invited fans to ""bring cash."" It goes on to say, ""We have asked from the beginning that all travelers have enough money to pay for their basic expenses.""  There were also reports of staged fan marches in which Indian guest workers, among others, dressed up as Brazilian or German fans.",114
